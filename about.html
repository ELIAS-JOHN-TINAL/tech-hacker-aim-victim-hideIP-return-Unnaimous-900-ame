        <div class="about-details">
            <h2>My biography</h2>
            <p>I was born on the 12th december 2001 in the Mendi general hospital. My parents gave birth to four(4) childrens and amongst which I  was the third born to suck milk from my mother's breast. I came from an extended family where we live together with our grandparents and relatives. In my childhood days I spent most of my time in the village. Since, I was enrolled and get a formal education I started to realize the prime importance of the transformative power that education holds for unique individuals. And growing up I had the passion about science and my I was much eager to know most the environments at the immature class. Since then, when I completed my High school in 2020 I got an offer to do my secondary education but then decided not due to personal circumstances. And during our class streamong they just put me into taking block science due to my outstanding academic performance across all subjects with all distinctions. And later in 2023 I was selected to take the bachelor degree in the field of science faculty majoring Computer Science and Mathematice advancing in the field of software engineering in 2024. And i believe in the future after the completion of bachelor degree I would further my master's and PhD doctorate in computer science. MY mind never stop exploring, filled with critical thinking and Innovatove ideas. </p>
            <h2>My Educational background & Skills</h2>
            <p>
                I hold a Bachelor's degree in software engineering, cybersecurity, Mathematics and Computer Science from Divine Word University, where I developed a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computing. My coursework included a range of topics such as data structures, algorithms, programming languages, and software engineering, which helped me become proficient in problem-solving and technical implementation.
            </p>
            <p>I have honed my skills in: Programming Languages: C, C++, Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS</p>
            <h2>My Experiences</h2>
            <p>
                I have been fortunate to work on various projects that have allowed me to enhance my technical expertise.
            </p>

        <p>Web Development: Expertise in building responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a growing interest in learning modern frameworks like React</p>
            <p>Personal Projects: I built a banking system as part of my coursework using C, which included features like checking balances, withdrawals, and transfers. I also worked on a data analytics project where I analyzed large datasets and provided insights using Python's data analysis libraries.</p>

            Software Tools: Proficient in using version control systems like Git, and development environments like Visual Studio and Eclipse, Virtual Machine, Kali Linux etc..


<p>My education has equipped me with not only the technical skills but also the ability to think critically and creatively, which I apply to both academic projects and real-world scenarios. Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning, especially in the areas of software development and data analysis as the field of computer science is ever increasing at an alarming rate where it has been predicted that by 2050 everything including humana manual labour will be highly replaced by computers and the world will only be controlled by computer scientists in every working part of life both in terms of economy and educational pursuits.
</p>




            <h2>My Hobbies & Interests</h2>
            <p>
           I am fond of Computer Gaming, investing in online money business, programming challenges, learning new technologies, or personal project plus learning computer ethical hacking in HTB academy cybersecurity online courses.
